## Starter Kits

Deployment Starter Kits are quick guides intended for technical folks reponsible for implementing Delinea products into their environment. The idea with these documents is that it is a brief summary of what the product does, and what infrastructure and port requirements are needed to support a bare-bones installation of said product.

With these guides, the hope is that most of the common "what do we need" questions are addressed by a 5-10 page .pdf.
