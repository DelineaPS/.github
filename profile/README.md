## Welcome to Delinea's Professional Services organization on GitHub

This organization is maintained by Delinea's Professional Services team and will provide common solutions and documentation that we experience in the field.

No customer specific information will be contained in any documents or scripts placed in these repos.

## Starter Kits

Deployment Starter Kits are quick guides intended for technical folks reponsible for implementing Delinea products into their environment. The idea with these documents is that it is a brief summary of what the product does, and what infrastructure and port requirements are needed to support a bare-bones installation of said product.

With these guides, the hope is that most of the common "what do we need" questions are addressed by a 5-10 page .pdf.

Each product will have its own Starter Kit guide as separate repos.

## Community Editions

Community Editions are Bookdown (https://bookdown.org/) websites that will contain PS-contributed articles for PS and customers alike to assist with quirks or special use cases that are not covered by online documentation. For example, if online documentation contains an article on how to integrate Okta with Cloud Suite, but does not have one covering integration of RSA with Cloud Suite, then the Community Edition is the place for such an article. Over time, this resource should be very useful for consultants and customers alike.

Contributing an article is also very simple. A folder with a plain-text file (an .Rmd, RMarkdown) and any associated graphics is all that is needed to contribute an article. No special software is required.

Bookdown websites are also mobile-friendly and offer a Delinea-branded .pdf download for offline view.

Each product will have its own Community Edition guide as separate repos.
